# face-recognition
Simple module to recognise faces that appear on your camera, you can provide custom ones (even your own one)
by placing a picture of your face in /resources folder.

# Running
Tested with Python3.8 and works fine.
Tried on Python3.10 and keep getting 'undefined symbol: png_do_expand_palette_rgb8_neon' error which is caused by some dlib incompatibility

To run: python main.py

## Workaround
Install anaconda and you can have access to multiple versions
